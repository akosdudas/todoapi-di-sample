            EMailSender will need to be instantiated by the container when resolving IEMailSender, and the constructor 
            parameters must be specified appropriately. The logger parameter is completely "OK", and the container can 
            resolve it based on the ILogger-> Logger container mapping registration. However, there is no way to find out
            the value of the smtpAddress parameter. To solve this problem, ASP.NET Core proposes an "options" mechanism
            for the framework, which allows us to retrieve the value from some configuration. Covering the "options" topic 
            would be a far-reaching thread for us, so for simplification we applied another approach. The AddSingleton 
            (and other Add ... operations) have an overload in which we can specify a lambda expression. This lambda is 
            called by the container later at the resolve step (that is, when we ask the container for an IEMailSender 
            implementation) for each instance. With the help of this lambda we manually create the EMailSender object, 
            so we have the chance to provide the necessary constructor parameters. In fact, the container is really 
            "helpful" with us: it provides an IServiceCollection object as the lambda parameter for us (in this example
            it's called sp), and based on container registrations we can conveniently resolve types with the help of 
            the already covered GetRequiredService and GetService calls.
