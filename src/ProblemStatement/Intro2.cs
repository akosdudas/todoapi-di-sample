    //
    // The the functional requirements are unchanged.
    // We improved out previous solution in the following points:
    // * The NotificationService class no longer instantiates its dependencies itself, but receives
    //   them in constructor parameters.
    // * Interfaces(abstractions) have been introduced to manage dependencies
    //   The NotificationService class gets its dependencies in the form of interfaces. When a
    //   class receives its dependencies externally(e.g. via constructor parameters), it is called
    //   DEPENDENCY INJECTION(DI).
    // * In our case, the classes get their class dependencies in constructor parameters: this
    //   specific form of DI is called CONSTRUCTOR INJECTION. This is the most common - and most
    //   recommended - way to inject dependency. (Alternatively, for example, we could use property
    //    injection, which is based on a public property setter to set a specific dependency of a class).
    // * NotificationService dependencies are instantiated by the (direct) USER of the class
    // Most of the downsides of our previous solution have been eliminated.

    // We are still facing with a few problems:
    // * The user of NotificationService objects, which is the ToDoService class, is still dependent
    //   on the implementation types (since it has to instantiate the Logger,EMailSender and
    //   ContactRepository classes).
    // * If we use the Logger, EMailSender and ContactRepository classes at multiple places in your
    //   application, we must instantiate them explicitly. In other words: at each and every place
    //   where have to create an ILogger, IEMailSender or IContactRepository implementation class,
    //   we have to make a decision which implementation to choose. This is essentially a special case
    //   of code duplication, the decision should appear only once in our code.
    //
    // We will further improve our solution implemented in this source file later (see TodoController):
    // * We will utilize the dependency injection (IoC container) services of ASP.NET Core.
    //   These will be the basics of our transformation:
    //   * We will register dependency mappings (e.g. ILogger-> Logger, IMailSender-> EMailSender) into an IoC
    //     container, once, at a centralized location, at application startup. This is the REGISTER
    //     step of the DI process.
    //   * When we need an implementation object at runtime in our application, we ask the container for an
    //     implementation by specifying the abstraction (interface) type (e.g., by providing ILogger
    //     as a key, the container returns an object of class Logger).
    //   * The resolve step is typically done at the "entry point" of the application (e.g. in case of
    //     WebApi on the receival of web requests, we will look into this later). The resolve step is
    //     performed only for the ROOT OBJECT (e.g. for the appropriate Controller class in case of WebApi).
    //     The container creates and returns a root object and all its dependencies and all its indirect
    //     dependencies: an entire object graph is generated. This process is called AUTOWIRING.
    //     Note: In case of Web API calls, the Resolve step is executed by the Asp.Net framework and is mostly
    //     hidden from the developer: all we see is that our controller class is automatically instantiated
    //     and all constructor parameters are automatically populated(with the help of the IoC container
    //     based on the mappings of the REGISTER step).
